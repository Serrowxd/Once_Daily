# Just some website concepts that I haven't cooked up yet, but will likely in the future for projects.

## Once Daily

The glorious repository that I've been committing to, I want a website that will house all the projects links that I've worked on going forwards - something similar to the project section on my portfolio. I think it would be super cool to have a home for all of it.

## IIRC Channel

Just something to say I did it, nothing special, but a place where you can list chats and then respond to them in real time. Would be cool to have.

## Twitch Bot - or similar Website Project?

Unsure how a twitch bot would be relevant to a website a day project, but we'll see. Maybe I can make an exception for this.

## I Hate LFG - React

Dip into the I Hate LFG meta with a full React page, would be exciting.
