Just some website concepts that I haven't cooked up yet, but will likely in the future for projects.

# Once Daily Projects (Small)

#### IRC Channel

Just something to say I did it, nothing special, but a place where you can list chats and then respond to them in real time. Would be cool to have, could do it with Socket.io for the practice.

#### Twitch Bot - or similar Website Project?

Unsure how a twitch bot would be relevant to a website a day project, but we'll see. Maybe I can make an exception for this.

#### Linney's Ceramics

Website for Grandma's Ceramics!

---

# Monthly Projects (Larger)

#### I Hate LFG

Firebase, NodeJS or Django, React.

#### Writehub

Github, for Writers! Getting those squares as daily inspiration and progress tracking. Likely going to be using DJango and Digital Ocean for this deployment because it's all text based - React, and then maybe Firebase/OAuth.

Could also implement the ability to have an IRC & shared document edit feature that allows more than one person to work on the same file - similar to how Google Drive would work.
