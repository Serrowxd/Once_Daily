# Day 1 - October 25, 2018

Day 1 of "Once Daily" - I found a website that I wanted to revamp, so I gave it a quick personalized spin. 2 hours of fingers on code brought this beauty to life. The main inspiration was trying to create something that doesn't use routes to shift between pages - much like how I do with state based navigations in React through DOM manipulation.

# Day 2 - October 26, 2018

Day 2 I created a portfolio Website for a good friend who just so happens to be a very talented video editor!

**Used:** HTML, LESS

# Day 3 - October 27, 2018

Today I created a simple website for a friend - my attempt was to utilize window scroll binds to run animations for me at different scrollY positions. This project features a fully-implemented pull from the Twitch.tv API, where it dynamically parses the top 4 clips of Shen's stream to the page. All done in vanilla JavaScript and HTML!

It also includes the wonderful Particle.js, as well as a live embeded video feed directly from his stream whenever he goes live.

**Used:** HTML, LESS, JQuery

# Day 4 - October 28, 2018

This project was actually the brain child of a good friend when we were going to school together. The idea is basically a website that allows the user to look-up, rate, and otherwise identify the players in the Looking For Group section of World of Warcraft for PvP. Current tools exist for PvE, but nothing really exists in the PvP market - so you're really left to the mercy of chance.

I attempted implementation of the Blizzard API on this project - however with their secruity features I was unable to crack into it with my allotted time for this sprint. I was able to grab the information I needed via Postman requests, but full implementation of the functionality will likely be done via React in the future.

**Used:** HTML, LESS, JQuery
