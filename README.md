# Day 1 - October 25, 2018

Day 1 of "Once Daily" - I found a website that I wanted to revamp, so I gave it a quick personalized spin. 2 hours of fingers on code brought this beauty to life. The main inspiration was trying to create something that doesn't use routes to shift between pages - much like how I do with state based navigations in React through DOM manipulation.

**Used:** HTML, LESS, JQuery
