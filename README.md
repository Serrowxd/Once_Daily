# Day 1 - October 25, 2018

Day 1 of "Once Daily" - I found a website that I wanted to revamp, so I gave it a quick personalized spin. 2 hours of fingers on code brought this beauty to life. The main inspiration was trying to create something that doesn't use routes to shift between pages - much like how I do with state based navigations in React through DOM manipulation.

**Used:** HTML, LESS, JQuery

# Day 3 - October 27, 2018

Today I created a simple website for a friend - my attempt was to utilize window scroll binds to run animations for me at different scrollY positions. This project features a fully-implemented pull from the Twitch.tv API, where it dynamically parses the top 4 clips of Shen's stream to the page. All done in vanilla JavaScript and HTML!

It also includes the wonderful Particle.js, as well as a live embeded video feed directly from his stream whenever he goes live.
